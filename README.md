- 👋 Hi, I’m @beardandbag 
- 👀 I’m interested in 
  -  Technology of all kinds, but especially cloud and green/ecotech
  -  How to use that technology for good
  -  Outdoor gardening and indoor hydro/aeroponics
  -  Art (mostly photography)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
  -  python, like seemingly everybody else.  
  -  how to 'be public' without giving up my privacy.
  -  Would like to take a month or two off and really get my mind around Rust, to help compensate up for all those years of Java. ;)
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything at the moment-- still getting my feet wet.  But hopefully soon. :)
